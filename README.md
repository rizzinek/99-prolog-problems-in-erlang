# 99-prolog-problems-in-erlang
My solutions for the ["99 prolog problems"](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)
in Erlang programming language with comments.

I am just learning Erlang without having any previous
Prolog or functional programming experince so I thought this would be a good
way to get a solid grasp on the language syntax and its standard library.
